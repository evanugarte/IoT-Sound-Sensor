# SmartNoiseSense
Using ESP32s, sound sensors and Google Cloud Platform, this project tracks the noise levels of the Software and Computer Engineering Society's club room.

## Project Folder Description
The project is split into three folders, `GoogleCloud` `SoundRead` and `StudentWebsite`.
- GoogleCloud: Contains the code for the functions that are executed in the cloud to handle published messages.
- SoundRead: Holds all of the code that is flashed onto the ESP32 to read noise and publish the data to a Google PubSub topic.
- StudentWebsite: Holds all of the website code, written using React.js, to read the room's current noise level and past readings.

## To Run the Student Website
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - You can verify the installation by entering `node --version` in your terminal
2. With node installed, clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/evanugarte/SmartNoiseSense` or download the `.zip` file
3. Enter the directory with `cd SmartNoiseSense/StudentWebsite`
4. Install dependencies with `npm install`
5. Run the website with `npm run start`
